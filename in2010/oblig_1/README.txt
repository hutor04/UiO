BSTree.java - Binary search tree. Note: the tree allows the insertion of duplicate values.
RBTree.java - Red-Black tree implementation (supports add/remove, test if valid RB-tree)

BSTtest.java - test file from subject page. I made some changes in it:
findParent() and findGrandparent() methods are implemented but are not used since the pointers to the parents are stored
in the Node class.

myBSTreeTest.java - test class for BSTtree and RBTree. Run the main there.
